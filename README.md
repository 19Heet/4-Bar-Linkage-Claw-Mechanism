# 4-Bar-Linkage-Claw-Mechanism
This project consists of a 3D modeling approaching using a computer aided design software, for this project I have used Solidworks. The purpose of this project is to create and design a 3d model that is capable of operating required tasks. These tasks include the functionability to pickup 3/4 inch diameter metal, sytrofoam, and plastic balls from the bin and allocate it with each bin presented. The final assembly consists of 3 subasssembles which involves the Roatating Base Assembly, Claw Assembly, and Arm Assembly. Each seperate part files contains specific and well calculated dimensions which allow for prototype implementation and succesful task completion. The design can succesfully pickup the heavist ball amongst the three and allocate it with the further bin. The design is specifically design for it to be laser cut. The solidwork files are invididually converted into dwg files and combined in a 8x10 plate for laser cutting. This design was then taken into a physical aspect and a protoype was built to simulate the task in real.
