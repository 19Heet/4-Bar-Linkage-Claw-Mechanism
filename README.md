# 4-Bar-Linkage-Claw-Mechanism
This project consists of a 3D modeling approach using a computer aided design software, for this project I have used Solidworks. The purpose of this project is to create and design a 3d model that is capable of operating required tasks. These tasks include the functionality to pick up 3/4 inch diameter metal, styrofoam, and plastic balls from the bin and allocate it with each bin presented. The dimensions were set to satisfy the requirements of the ball court. The final assembly consists of 3 separate subassemblies which involve the Rotating Base Assembly, Claw Assembly, and Arm Assembly. Each separate part file contains specific and well calculated dimensions which allow for prototype implementation and successful task completion. The design can successfully pick up the heaviest ball amongst the three and allocate it with the further bin. The design is specifically designed for it to be laser cut. The solid work files are individually converted into dwg files and combined in a 8x10 plate for laser cutting. This design was then taken into a physical aspect and a prototype was built to simulate the task in real.
